<!-- 2. Introduction
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc -->

<!-- 4. Basic
All HTML documents must start wit a document type declaration
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body> -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- 6. Attributes
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page
This is meant to assist search engines and browsers
Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute
So, the first two characters define the language of the HTLM page, and the last two characters define the country -->
<html lang="en-US">

    <!-- 27. Head
    The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag
    The <title> element defines the title of the document
    The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab
    The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page
    The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource
    The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets
    The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings
    The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts
    The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page
    The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both -->
    <head>
        <style></style>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="w3schools.css">
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
        <meta name="description" content="this is description">
        <meta name="author" content="Seungho Jang">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=0.5">
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60">

        <!-- 18. Page Title
        The <title> element adds a title to your page -->
        <title>w3schools</title>

        <!-- 17. Favicon
        A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab
        To add a favicon to your website, save your favicon image
        Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element -->
        <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
        
    </head>

    <body>

        <!-- 5. Elements
        The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag
        HTML elements with no content are called empty elements
        The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag -->
        <br>

        <!-- 6. Attributes
        All HTML elements can have attributes
        Attributes provide additional information about elements
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
        The style attributes is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
        The title attribute defines some extra information about an element
        The value of the attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element           -->
        <p style="color: red;">
            this is p
        </p>
        <p title="this is title">
            this is p
        </p>
            
        <!-- 7. Headings
        HTML Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags
        <h1> defines the most important heading, <h6> defines the least important heading -->
        <h1>this is h1</h1>
        <h2>this is h2</h2>
        <h3>this is h3</h3>
        <h4>this is h4</h4>
        <h5>this is h5</h5>
        <h6>this is h6</h6>

        <!-- 8. Paragraphs
        HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag
        A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph
        With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code
        The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed
        The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule
        The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text
        The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both space and line breaks -->
        <p>this is p</p>
        <hr>
        <pre>
            this is pre

            this is pre

            this is pre
        </pre>

        <!-- 9. Styles
        The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size and more

        If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element
        To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat
        If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover
        Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed

        A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element
        A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)
        An inline element does not start on a new line
        An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary
        The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements
        The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document -->

        It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name
        To create a class, write a period (.) character, followed by a class name
        Then define the CSS properties within curly braces {}
        To define multiple classes, seperate the class names with a spaces -->

        <!-- 23. id
        The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element
        The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document
        The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet
        It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id
        The syntax for id is, write a hash character (#), followed by an id name
        Then define the CSS properties within curly braces {} -->

        <!-- 28. layout
        HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page
        <header> defines a header for a document or a section
        <nav> defines a set of navigation links
        <section> defines a section in a document
        <article> defines an independent, self-contained content
        <aside> defines content aside from the content
        <footer> defines a footer for a document or a section
        <details> defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
        <summary> defines a heading for the <details> element 
        It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property
        Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices
        The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning -->

        <!-- 29. Responsive
        Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones)
        If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down
        If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger thant its original size
        The text size can be set ith a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width" -->
